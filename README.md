# Leaflet-challenge

This assignment was to understand the use of leaflet and its capabilities with mapping. This assignment consists of two parts, one for displaying the earthquake reports while the second part involved superimposing the tectonic plates onto the map. 

For the first part, the task was to visualise the earthquake dataset. This was obtained from USGS GeoJSON Feed site and the dataset used was 'All Earthquakes from the Past 7 Days'. One of the key aspects of this task was for the data markers to reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and and depth of the earth quake by color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes should appear larger and earthquakes with greater depth should appear darker in color. In this instance, the colour scheme used ranged from red (for the most active) to limegreen (for the least active). 

For the second part, the task was to plot a second data set on the map to illustrate the relationship between tectonic plates and seismic activity. This data was obtained here : https://github.com/fraxen/tectonicplates.

The final page showcases the work completed.
