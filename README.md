# Leaflet-challenge

This assignment was to understand the use of leaflet and its capabilities with mapping. This assignment consists of two parts, one for displaying the earthquake reports while the second part involved superimposing the tectonic plates onto the map. 

For the first part, the task was to visualise the earthquake dataset. This was obtained from USGS GeoJSON Feed site and the dataset used was 'All Earthquakes from the Past 7 Days'.

For the second part, the task was to plot a second data set on the map to illustrate the relationship between tectonic plates and seismic activity.
